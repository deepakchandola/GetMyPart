# GetMyPart
##
Different OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) give their parts different unique names. Take a scenario where you take your vehicle for repair and it needs a part replacement, Associate in dealership needs to search for the right part in Manufacturers website in different ways (as said earlier different OEMs has labeled/named their parts differently).

Idea here is to have a product where associate at dealer ship can take a picture of failed part and upload it to a system via mobile and he will get all similar Parts on screen and he/she can get the part and order it from there.
